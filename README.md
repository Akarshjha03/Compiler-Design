# 📚 Compiler Design  

Welcome to the **Compiler Design** repository! 🚀 This repository is a hands-on guide to learning and implementing the fundamental concepts of compiler design, covering everything from lexical analysis to target code generation. 🖥️✨

## 🧩 Key Features  

- 🖋 **Lexical Analysis**  
   Tokenizes the input source code and implements regular expressions for pattern matching.  

- 🌲 **Syntax Analysis**  
   Builds parse trees using LL(1) and LR parsers to ensure the code adheres to grammar rules.  

- ✅ **Semantic Analysis**  
   Implements type checking and symbol table management for accurate semantic evaluation.  

- 🎯 **Intermediate Code Generation**  
   Generates three-address code and uses syntax-directed translation schemes.  

- ⚡ **Code Optimization**  
   Enhances the efficiency of intermediate code through optimization techniques.  

- 🛠 **Target Code Generation**  
   Produces low-level code (assembly or machine code) for execution.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies  

- **Programming Language**: [Your Language Here, e.g., Python, C++] 🐍/🔧  
- **Compiler Tools**: [Flex, Yacc, LLVM, etc.] 🛠
