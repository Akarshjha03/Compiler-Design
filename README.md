  - Error detection for invalid tokens.
- **Usage:**
  - Input: Source code.
  - Output: List of tokens.

---

## 2. 🔢 Count Digits, Vowels, and Symbols
- **Description:**
  A simple program to count the number of digits, vowels, and special symbols in a given input string.
- **Features:**
  - Accurate counts for different character types.
- **Usage:**
  - Input: String.
  - Output: Count of digits, vowels, and symbols.

---

## 3. 🔒 Username and Password Validation
- **Description:**
  A program to validate usernames and passwords based on predefined rules such as length, allowed characters, and format.
- **Features:**
  - Checks for valid usernames.
  - Ensures strong password compliance.
- **Usage:**
  - Input: Username and password.
  - Output: Validation result.

---

## 4. 📘 Predictive Parsing LL(1)
- **Description:**
  Implementation of LL(1) predictive parsing using a parsing table and grammar rules.
- **Features:**

  - Output: Evaluation result.

---

## 7. 📈 LALR Parsing
- **Description:**
  Study and implementation of Look-Ahead LR (LALR) parsing for grammar analysis.
- **Features:**
  - Combines the power of LR and SLR parsers.
  - Efficient parsing for complex grammars.
- **Usage:**
  - Input: Grammar and string.
  - Output: Parsing result.
